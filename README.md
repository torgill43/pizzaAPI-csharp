# Overview
I have worked with APIs and the MVC structure previously in Node.js, but wanted to expand my skills in another language I'm more familiar with, C#. To do this, I created a simple web API that delivers data regarding a pizza order. Though this project does not (yet) have a functioning frontend, CRUD operations can be performed using SwaggerUI. This project is linked to a SQL relational database that is stored locally.
